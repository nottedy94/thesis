  title={An ecological study of the heath balds of the Great Smoky mountains}, 
  volume={1}, 
  abstractNote={The inhabitants of the Great Smoky mountains usually refer to the heath communities under consideration as “slicks” or “balds.” The former name is derived from the smooth appearance they present on the ridges and mountain tops when viewed from a distance and which is entirely misleading, for they are extremely rough and tangled. The name “bald” refers to the absence of trees, these areas being exclusively occupied by shrubs. The term “heath bald” is used in this paper to include all such treeless areas dominated by members of the order Ericales. The use of the term “heath” is not entirely satisfactory, since there is considerable confusion in the literature in respect to the exact meaning of such terms as “heath,” “low moor,” “high moor,” etc" yet no substitute for the term has been found. One derives from Tansley, in “Types of British Vegetation,” that heathland involves poor, dry, sandy soils, usually with a thin layer of dry peat or “trochentorf.” The ’climate can best be described as oceanic where heathland is characteristic, and where the rainfall is greater, up to forty and sixty inches, relatively pure acid humus may develop to a foot in depth. This type of community is considered by Warming (23) under the heading “Dwarf Shrub Heath,” where he says that in the Alps, associated with the forest and above the timber line, heaths are formed by various plants, and that in Azalea-heath the layer of raw humus may attain a thickness of half a meter. In distinction to Tansley, Warming considers the production of raw humus as the most characteristic peculiarity of heath, while they agree in respect to the climatic conditions. Warming states that the “dwarf shrub heath occurs only in arctic and alpine sites, also in the oceanic west coasts of the cold-temperate zone that are characterized by cool summers.” In the Great Smoky mountains, areas of heath are to be found with a development of dry peat, particularly at lower altitudes, but the majority of the heath balds have a remarkable development of moist, fibrous brown peat, frequently to a depth of one and two feet. The surface of the peat under the ericaceous shrubs is frequently covered with a dense mat of Sphagnum and other peat-forming mosses. Other species of moss and lichens, as Cladonia and Usnea, may be festooned over the branches, particularly when the balds are at an elevation of 6,000 feet or more. The presence of peat-forming mosses suggests the possible application of the term “moor” or “high-moor” to these areas. Warming (23), page 200, says: “The moor known as high-moor, Sphagnum-moor or heather-moor, is mainly formed by bog-moss (Sphagnum) and arises on moist soil, which is only slightly permeable to water, though very damp air hangs over it. Humid air and dew are essential to sphagnummoor, which acquires the whole of its moisture from atmospheric precipitations. It often arises on top of old low-mqor; it may also take origin on wet sand, and even on rocks if these be frequently wet, as on the west coast of Norway and Sweden.” Thus it would seem that the distinction between moor and heath rests on the presence or absence of Sphagnum; yet heather-moor and dwarf shrub heath, from descriptions, are frequently indistinguishable. However, the following differences between the peat-forming areas of the Great Smoky mountains and true high-moor occur to the writer as distinguishing the two: (1) the high-moor has a convex surface like a watch glass (the sort of thing known as “raised bog” in this country); (2) the high-moor is characterized by the presence of “carnivorous” plants. Altogether, the term “heath bald” seems preferable to “moor” in this connection. The term “pine-heath,” or kiefern-heide, is not subject to the same confusion, since the pines are associated with the heath shrubs under conditions too dry for Sphagnum and the formation of moist brown peat. Harshberger (19 and 20), in describing the New Jersey Pine. Barrens, says that “pine-heath is found where the climate is continental.” In comparison with the climate of the heath districts, the pineheath regions are marked by increase in range of annual and diurnal temperatures, rainfall is less, skies are more frequently cloudless and the air is drier and dustier. In the Great Smoky mountains the pineheath is quite constant in aspect, but the heath balds show a number of facies, the principal variations of which are tied up with changes concomitant with increased altitude.},

  abstractNote={Grassy balds are unique Appalachian wonders, open meadows in the mountains where, ecologically, there should be trees. It has been hypothesized that some of the balds originated more than ten thousand years ago and were kept open by the grazing of large herbivores such as the mastodon and the wooly mammoth. Over the course of earth’s history, environmental and anthropogenic factors have shaped, modified and maintained the balds. Up to one hundred grassy balds were once recognized to exist in the southern Appalachians, but fewer exist today due to forest succession (Gersmehl, 1970). Collectively, the grassy balds share a common ecological identity, but individually, each bald portrays its own personality, forged by a unique history of interplay between nature, grazers and humans. Indeed, the grassy balds have commanded human attention for centuries. Their presence in primary literature and lore originates with Native American folklore and extends all the way to the present day management plans set by policymakers. The starting point for this sense of timeless human interest is the profound, breathtaking beauty of the grassy balds. The balds’ natural beauty, along with their ecological value and captivating histories, inspired the idea to create an informative hiking guide for a selection of twenty-five southern Appalachian grassy balds. The first part of the project consisted of a literature review; sources were evaluated for information pertaining to flora and fauna, explanations of origin, history of anthropogenic influence and history of management policies. For each of the grassy balds selected to be featured, a hike was completed, and both a detailed trail description and a concise historical summary were written.  GPS tracks were taken, waypoints were identified and photos were documented. Ultimately, the trail descriptions, summaries, maps, pictures and significant literary information were synthesized into an informative hiking guide to be published by University of South Carolina Press. The information presented in this article is meant to provide a scholarly account of the grassy balds beginning with their histories of origin, tracking the impact they received from the European settlers and including their present day outlook for conservation. It is a work based on published literature about the grassy balds as well as my personal experiences gained during the course of the project. As a work published in Caravel Undergraduate Research Journal, this article is available to the public and represents a unique academic endeavor that I had as an undergraduate at the University of South Carolina. This article may also be disseminated through other publishing outlets as a resource for education and awareness about the grassy balds.},

  abstractNote={1. Characterization of the seed bank is one of the most important demographic assessments that can be undertaken for a plant community. Overlapping generations, evidence of past above-ground vegetation and histories of invasion and disturbance are recorded in the seed bank. 2. Two broad approaches have been used to elucidate seed bank components – sifting-sorting techniques and germinability assays. The utility of these approaches varies with community type and habitat although a common theme among studies has been the quest for an efficacious method. Here, we compare the two approaches for semi-arid ephemeral wetlands: seed extraction through flotation and seedling emergence. 3. Species composition of the soil seed bank differed dramatically depending on the technique, with only 19 species common to both methods and a total of 66 species detected using both procedures. 4. Both techniques provided similar estimates of seed density and species richness of the seed bank in the top 5 cm of soil. However, samples collected from 5 cm to 20 cm had lower seed densities using the flotation technique than with the seedling emergence technique. 5. Differences in seed detectability between the two approaches may be related to seed size, seed dormancy and specific germination requirements. 6. The community composition of soil seed banks for ephemeral wetlands depends on the choice of technique.},

  abstractNote={Within the Roan Mountain massif in the southern Appalachian Mountains, grassy balds are important, yet threatened ecosystems dominated by native graminoids with many endemic and endangered species. Restoration efforts have been conducted for 30 years by several agencies. In 1987–1988 a vegetation analysis was conducted on these balds to characterize plant communities before intensive management began. In summer 2020, we resurveyed the vegetation using similar methodologies on Round, Jane, and part of Grassy Ridge Balds to assess the impact of management activities. Percent coverage of vegetation type was recorded in 226 one m2 plots along 11 transects. Management history was compiled for individual plots. Percent cover data were subjected to cluster analysis, principal components analysis (PCA), non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS), and regression. Cluster analysis of sampled plots revealed 12 plant community groups. PCA revealed plots separating along a gradient of blackberry and grass cover, as well as blackberry, grass, and fern cover. Results from NMS showed less separation of plots compared to PCA with most plots clustering in the center, except those with high bare ground coverage. A significant positive relationship was seen between graminoid cover and management frequency and a negative relationship with the amount of time since management activity. All of the relationships had low explanatory power suggesting that other factors might influence the plant populations. Our research shows there is a positive association with graminoid cover and increased management frequency, but more research involving other biotic and abiotic factors and management history should be explored.},

  abstractNote={Soil seed banks are especially important for forest regeneration in stands with few understory species and individuals. The understory of hemlock (Tsuga canadensis)-dominated stands in New England primarily consists of hemlock seedlings and saplings, but all size classes of hemlock are attacked by the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae). Prior to the initiation of a large-scale manipulative experiment designed to examine the impact of the adelgid on hemlock forest ecology, we documented the seed bank composition of eight large (0.81 ha) experimental hemlock-dominated and young hardwood-dominated plots. The seed bank samples from the hemlock-dominated plots contained significantly fewer species (rarefied species richness = 24; 95% confidence interval = 20–28) than those from the hardwood-dominated plots (species richness = 30). Seed banks from all plots were dominated by Betula lenta, Rubus spp., and Carex pensylvanica. Among plots, there was little compositional relationship between the forest overstory and its understory on the one hand, and its seed bank on the other hand. Because seeds of hemlock and birch persist for only a few years in the seed bank, and because hemlock seedlings are readily attacked and killed by the adelgid, damaged hemlock stands are more likely to be replaced by stands of black birch and other hardwoods than by hemlock.},

  abstractNote={Temperate montane grasslands and their unique biotas are declining worldwide as they are increasingly being invaded by forests. The origin and persistence of these landscapes have been the focus of such controversy that in many areas their conservation is in doubt. In the USA some biologists have largely dismissed the grass balds of the Southern Appalachians as human artifacts or anomalous and transitory elements of regional geography, worthy of only limited preservation efforts. On the basis of information from biogeography, community ecology, regional history and palaeontology and from consideration of two other montane grassland ecosystems—East Carpathian poloninas and Oregon Coast Range grass balds—we hypothesize that these landscapes are more widespread than was formerly recognized; they are, in many cases, natural and ancient and largely owe their origin and persistence to past climatic extremes and the activities of large mammalian herbivores.},
