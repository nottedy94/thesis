Restoration efforts have been conducted for 30 years by several agencies. In 1987? 1988 a vegetation analysis was conducted on these balds to characterize plant communities before intensive management began. In summer 2020, we resurveyed the vegetation using similar methodologies on Round, Jane, and part of Grassy Ridge Balds to assess the impact of management activities. Percent coverage of vegetation type was recorded in 226 one m2 plots along 11 transects. Management history was compiled for individual plots. Percent cover data were subjected to cluster analysis, principal components analysis (PCA), non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS), and regression. Cluster analysis of sampled plots revealed 12 plant community groups. PCA revealed plots separating along a gradient of blackberry and grass cover, as well as blackberry, grass, and fern cover. Results from NMS showed less separation of plots compared to PCA with most plots clustering in the center, except those with high bare ground coverage. A significant positive relationship was seen between graminoid cover and management frequency and a negative relationship with the amount of time since management activity. All of the relationships had low explanatory power suggesting that other factors might influence the plant populations. Our research shows there is a positive association with graminoid cover and increased management frequency, but more research involving other biotic and abiotic factors and management history should be explored.}, number={1}, journal={Castanea}, publisher={Southern Appalachian Botanical Society}, author={Stokes, Cecelia and Horton, Jonathan L.}, year={2022}, month={Jun}, pages={105-120} }

 title={Characterizing soil seed banks and relationships to plant communities}, volume={214}, ISSN={1573-5052}, DOI={10.1007/s11258-013-0200-3}, abstractNote={Estimates of soil seed banks are important to many ecological investigations and plant conservation, yet seed banks are among the most difficult plant community attributes to accurately quantify. To compare extraction and emergence seed bank characterization methods, we collected 0- to 5-cm soil seed bank samples and measured plant community composition in six microsite types (below different perennial plant species and interspaces) at 10 field sites in the Mojave Desert, USA. Extraction detected five times more species sample 1 and orders of magnitude greater seed density than emergence, though evaluating viability of extracted seed was not straightforward. Only 13% of 847 tested seeds from extraction emerged in follow-up assays. Considering all sites, species detection was more similar between methods: 21 taxa for emergence and 28 for extraction. Results suggest that: (i) capturing microsite variation is critical for efficiently estimating site-level desert seed banks; (ii) method comparisons hinged on the scale of analysis for species richness, as differences in species detection between methods diminished when increasing resolution from the sample to the regional scale; (iii) combining data from all seed bank methods provided the strongest correlation with vegetation; and (iv) improving knowledge of seed germinability is important for advancing both seed bank methods, including for extraction to evaluate the proportion of extracted seeds that are viable. Multifactor approaches that balance several effectiveness measures (e.g., both seed density and species detection at multiple scales) and procedural challenges are most likely to accurately represent complexity in tradeoffs for choosing methods to quantify soil seed banks.}, number={5}, journal={Plant Ecology}, author={Abella, Scott R. and Chiquoine, Lindsay P. and Vanier, Cheryl H.}, year={2013}, month={May}, pages={703-715}, language={en} }

Location Saguaro National Park, Arizona, United States. Methods Seed bank samples were collected from two microsite types (below-shrub canopies and interspaces between perennial plants) at plots within Pennisetum ciliare-invaded and untreated sites, non-invaded sites and sites with five frequencies of Pennisetum-removal treatments. Seed bank samples were characterized by seedling emergence and seed extraction methods. Results Assay method influenced whether we detected a significant Pennisetum-removal treatment response on Pennisetum detected in the seed bank. A treatment response was not observed using the emergence method. Using the extraction method, we found that untreated Pennisetum plots contained significantly more Pennisetum seed than removal treatments. Treatments did not affect detection of native seed banks using either method. Microsite type only had an effect on seed detected using the emergence method, where more perennial species and seed densities were detected below shrubs. Native species richness and estimated seed densities using extraction were correlated with emergence results (r = 0.52, N = 42, p < 0.001 and r = 0.56; N = 42, p < 0.001, respectively). Conclusions Results highlight several considerations for how different seed bank methods can influence interpretation of management treatments. Along with vegetation surveys, seed bank observations indicate that removal treatments successfully reduced Pennisetum in soil seed banks at invaded sites relative to invaded untreated sites. Natives were a significant proportion of seed banks, showing potential for native plants to establish after treatments of non-native plants. Results suggest potential to calibrate seed bank methods with each other to reconcile differences. Because viability of extracted seed was uncertain, further analysis may be necessary to test which assay method best predicts future vegetation.}, number={4}, journal={Applied Vegetation Science}, author={Chiquoine, Lindsay P. and Abella, Scott R.}, year={2018}, pages={626-635}, language={en} }

When using the seedling-emergence method to analyse a soil seed bank the greenhouse conditions should match the germination requirements of the species involved. Although the seedling-emergence method is common practice in ecological studies, the germination characteristics of many species are not known, or are only partly known. 2. Before carrying out a large-scale seed-bank study in a wet dune slack, we tested the water requirements of the species in the seed bank, comparing a waterlogged soil with a moist soil. Four species germinated in significantly larger numbers in a waterlogged soil, seven species in a moist soil and 11 species showed no significant difference. When a species was present in low densities, it was often missed using the less appropriate treatment. 3.

 title={The role of the soil seed bank in Southern Appalachian wildfire response}, abstractNote={Wildfire disturbance is likely to increase in Southern Appalachian forests due to climate change and anthropogenic land-use changes. The soil seedbank can be a source of plant community response after this disturbance. Fire can affect seeds and seed germination both positively and negatively, yet little is known about seedbank response to fire in this region. A seedbank study was conducted in the greenhouse from May 23, 2017 to January 9, 2018 using litter and mineral soil samples from burned (B) and unburned (U) plots in three mid-elevation sites to determine seedbank contribution to first-season plant community response following wildfires that swept through the region in fall, 2016. In addition, extant vegetation, woody and herbaceous seedlings, and environmental variables including canopy openness, litter cover, soil moisture, bare ground cover, temperature and tree and shrub mortality were surveyed in the field over the 2017 growing season. Seedbank-generated plant abundance and species richness were compared between B and U plots, and with field seedling and field tree communities. Seedbank abundance and richness were lower in B samples from the litter layer, but not the soil layer, suggesting that fire killed seeds near the surface but that seeds underground were insulated. Density and richness of field seedlings were higher in B plots than U plots, suggesting that post-fire environmental differences, not changes to the seedbank itself, control forest response to wildfire from the seedbank. High light, low litter, and fluctuating temperature in B plots favored germination. Species that responded most strongly in the field were generalist disturbance-adapted species such as black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), not species specifically adapted to fire. Some species, such as black locust and birches (Betula spp.), were more common in the seedbank than in extant vegetation. Recruitment from the seedbank after periodic disturbance may allow these species to persist at these sites. Overall, the seedbank can contribute to first-year post-fire vegetation response, and has the potential to shift species composition in Southern Appalachian forests.}, author={Monar, Kelder C. and University, NC DOCKS at Western Carolina}, year={2018}, language={English} }

 title={Relationships between soil seed bank, vegetation and soil fertility along an urbanisation gradient}, volume={11}, ISSN={1654-109X}, DOI={10.3170/2008-7-18448}, abstractNote={Abstract. Questions: How does urbanisation influence soil mineral nitrogen stocks (nitrate and ammonium stocks) and what are the consequences of these modifications on the functional diversity of the herbaceous vegetation (vascular plants) and the seed bank? Location: Nine study sites were located on an urbanisation gradient in the city of Rennes, France. Methods: Three urbanisation levels were defined: urban areas (high grey/green ratio), suburban (medium grey/green ratio) and periurban (low grey/green ratio). For each urbanisation level, nitrates and ammonium stocks were quantified; the herbaceous vegetation was surveyed as well as the soil seed bank (using the seedling emergence method). Results: Nitrate concentration increased with urbanisation (the nitrate level in urban plots was twice the concentration in periurban ones) whereas the ammonium level was higher in periurban areas than in urban areas. In urban plots, the vegetation and the seed bank were more nitrophilous, whereas the nitrogen requirement was lower for periurban species. The relationship between the seed bank and the above-ground vegetation was not significant. Conclusions: The higher nitrate concentration in the urban area appeared to be related to higher concentrations of atmospheric pollutants found in this area and lower ammonium levels may be related to the higher temperature in urban areas (leading to higher nitrification rates). The shift in the composition of the seed bank and vegetation appeared to be a consequence of higher nitrate stocks. The dissimilarity between the seed bank and vegetation may be caused by enhanced emergence of nitrophilous species in urban areas.}, number={3}, journal={Applied Vegetation Science}, author={Pellissier, Vincent and Rozé, Françoise and Aguejdad, Rahim and Quénol, Hervé and Clergeau, Philippe}, year={2008}, pages={325-334}, language={en} }

Characterization of the seed bank is one of the most important demographic assessments that can be undertaken for a plant community. Overlapping generations, evidence of past above-ground vegetation and histories of invasion and disturbance are recorded in the seed bank. 2. Two broad approaches have been used to elucidate seed bank components sifting-sorting techniques and germinability assays. The utility of these approaches varies with community type and habitat although a common theme among studies has been the quest for an efficacious method. Here, we compare the two approaches for semi-arid ephemeral wetlands: seed extraction through flotation and seedling emergence. 3. Species composition of the soil seed bank differed dramatically depending on the technique, with only 19 species common to both methods and a total of 66 species detected using both procedures. 4. Both techniques provided similar estimates of seed density and species richness of the seed bank in the top 5 cm of soil. However, samples collected from 5 cm to 20 cm had lower seed densities using the flotation technique than with the seedling emergence technique. 5. Differences in seed detectability between the two approaches may be related to seed size, seed dormancy and specific germination requirements. 6.

These high altitude treeless expanses, well known to native Americans and later grazed by white settlers, are now undergoing rapid succession which threatens a unique community of plants and animals. Whatever the balds origin and in spite of the apparent antiquity of some, much of the botanical literature insists that they are largely an artifact of relatively recent human disturbance, and, except for rare plant preservation, deserve only limited conservation effort. Such an interpretation lacks both a historical perspective and an appreciation of the possible dynamic nature of this community. The presence of both rare, endemic plants and northern relicts requiring open habitat suggests a long evolutionary history. Also, balds that are still grazed today have maintained both their biota and size. We suggest that some balds are indeed ancient and were maintained during the late Pleistocene by mammalian herbivores. Excavations at Saltville, Virginia and elsewhere reveal the presence of up to 20 species of large herbivores, including mammoth, mastodon, bison, horse, tapir, musk ox, and ground sloth until 10,000 years ago. Thereafter, the mountains supported bison, elk, and deer until European settlement. It is likely that, as in many other parts of the world, this special natural community is the result of long-term plant-animal interactions and thus worthy of preservation. Such preservation might best be affected by the use of wild and/or domestic herbivores.}, number={3}, journal={Growth and Change}, author={Weigl, Peter D. and Knowles, Travis W.}, year={1995}, pages={365-382}, language={en} }
