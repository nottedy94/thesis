# thesis

# 7.10.22

Research season is over. Data is entered. Soil samples were taken, just need to be put into soil. I need >4.5 cubic feet of soil to cover all 30 trays; 12 in fire, 12 out fire, 6 controls.

Upon taking soil samples it would be a good idea to discount plots with greater than 50% bare ground. I do not expect that samples 1.6 and 1.7 to grow anything because of the previous reason. 

I should start writing my methods while it's fresh.

# 6.27.22

So much has happened.
I finished the proposal, got approved to take samples, took all my sample, and even made an excel file of the data. There are also arcGIS shapefiles of the fire, 2020 plots, and 2022 plots. 
I'm good at stience. 

# 5.25.22

Between the last time an now I punched up the methods and otherwise completed the methods section. Nixed the bits about management plans, not important. Transferred the knitted .docx to PC for formatting edits.

# 5.20.22

Turned crappy introduction in thesis.rmd into crappy introduction of proposal.rmd. Started writing the methods section, mostly satisfied with the intro. Need to find good soil seed bank method that doesn't take a lot of soil.
Need at least 3 samples per transect per burned v unburned.

# 5.16.22

Set-up git repository. Created .bib files. Ensured that R will knit into a word document.

## part 2

Began writing a crappy Introduction. The idea behind it is; describe balds, give a brief history of round bald, describe the fire, relate the fire to plant community changes and management implications.
